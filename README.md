# RockEngine

RockEngine is going to be a high perfomance 3D game engine built on Vulkan. It aims to provide developers with a powerful and flexible platform for creating stunning 3D games.

## Features
Here's a table summarizing the features of RockEngine with emojis and brief descriptions:

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Vulkan Integration | âœ… Done | Efficient rendering using Vulkan API |
| Shader Reflection | âœ… Done | Ability to reflect shader data from modules |
| ImGui | âœ… Done | Able to use most of imgui features |
| Model Loading | ðŸš§ In Progress | Loading common 3D model formats |
| Texture Mapping | ðŸš§ In Progress | Basic texture mapping capabilities |
| Camera System | ðŸš§ In Progress | Basic camera controls and movement |
| Input Handling | ðŸš§ In Progress | Keyboard and mouse input handling |
| Lighting System | ðŸš§ In Progress | Implementing basic lighting types |
| Physics Engine | ðŸš§ In Progress | Basic physics and collision detection |
| Animation System | ðŸš§ In Progress | Support for skeletal animations |
| Audio System | ðŸš§ In Progress | Basic 3D audio support |
| GUI System | ðŸš§ In Progress | Basic graphical user interface components |
| Pipeline Caching | ðŸ”œ Planned | Optimization for drawcalls |
| Indirect Rendering | ðŸ”œ Planned | Implementation of indirect rendering |
| Advanced Rendering | ðŸ”œ Planned | PBR, HDR, and post-processing effects |
| Networking | ðŸ”œ Planned | Basic multiplayer support (long-term goal) |
| Scripting | ðŸ”œ Planned | Support for game logic scripting (e.g., C#) |
| Terrain System | ðŸ”œ Planned | Procedural terrain generation and rendering |
| Particle System | ðŸ”œ Planned | Advanced particle effects |
| Ray tracing | ðŸ”œ Planned | Just a ray tracing, for awesome lighting,shadows and etc |

Summary:
- âœ… Done: Core Vulkan integration and shader reflection are completed.
- ðŸš§ In Progress: Many fundamental engine features are currently being developed, including rendering pipeline, model loading, and basic systems for graphics, physics, and audio.
- ðŸ”œ Planned: Advanced features and optimizations are planned for future development, including pipeline caching, indirect rendering, and more sophisticated systems for rendering, networking, and gameplay.
## Installation

To get started with RockEngine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Lor9ndr/RockEngine.Vulkan.git
    cd RockEngine
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Vulkan SDK installed. You can download it from [LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home).

3. **Build the project:**
    Just use the Visual Studio 2022 

## Usage

To run a sample application using RockEngine:
(Sample app will be in development, for now just run the builded app)
