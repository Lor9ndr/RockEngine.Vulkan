# RockEngine

RockEngine is a high-performance 3D game engine built on Vulkan. It aims to provide developers with a powerful and flexible platform for creating stunning 3D games.

## Features

### Completed
- **Vulkan Integration**: Efficient rendering using Vulkan API.
- **Basic Rendering Pipeline**: Supports basic rendering of 3D models.
- **Shader Support**: Vertex and fragment shaders.
- **Model Loading**: Load models in common formats (e.g., OBJ, FBX).
- **Texture Mapping**: Basic texture mapping capabilities.
- **Camera System**: Basic camera controls and movement.
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard and mouse input handling.

### In Progress
- **Lighting System**: Implementing basic lighting (directional, point, and spotlights).
- **Physics Engine**: Basic physics and collision detection.
- **Animation System**: Skeletal animation support.
- **Audio System**: Basic 3D audio support.
- **GUI System**: Basic graphical user interface components.

### Planned
- **Pipeline caching**: for optimization of drawcalls
- **Indirect rendering**: Usage of indirect rendering
- **Advanced Rendering Techniques**: PBR, HDR, and post-processing effects.
- **Networking**: Basic networking for multiplayer support. (long way to do)
- **Scripting**: Scripting support for game logic (e.g., C#).
- **Terrain System**: Procedural terrain generation and rendering.
- **Particle System**: Advanced particle effects.

## Installation

To get started with RockEngine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Lor9ndr/RockEngine.Vulkan.git
    cd RockEngine
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Vulkan SDK installed. You can download it from [LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home).

3. **Build the project:**
    Just use the Visual Studio 2022 

## Usage

To run a sample application using RockEngine:
(Sample app will be in development, for now just run the builded app)
